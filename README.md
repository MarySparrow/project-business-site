# Business Site

Project 3 of Technigo bootcamp. Build a business site containing a sign up form and FAQ accordion built with javaScript. 

## The problem

Learning from the previous project to structire the "blue print" first before tackling the functionality worked well and saved some time on this project. 

The diffrent form selections was tricky but after a lot of tutorials and reading I managed to get the look I wanted. If I had more time I would definitely focus more on the design of the labels and default checkboxes. 

I am most proud of getting the javascript to work even though I needed to get some help with the last piece getting the arrow on the header to turn on click.
